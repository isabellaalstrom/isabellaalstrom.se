        Isabella is a full stack developer with a great interest in technology, both software and hardware. She
        entered the development field through her previous profession in accessibility for television, where a
        previously dormant interest in programming flourished when new systems were to be developed.
        Isabella started her career in development via the polytechnic program System Development .NET at
        Nackademin.

        After an earlier focus on backend, curiosity and her own will to develop have recently driven her more
        towards frontend. She is attracted by the ability to control the user experience, with stylish and
        accessible interfaces.
